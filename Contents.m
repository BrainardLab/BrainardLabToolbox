% BrainardLabToolbox
%
% Routines that are general enough so that they might be useful for the whole
% lab, but not so general that they're ready for wider distribution.
%
% Bayes                  - Various functions related to distributions and Bayesian calculations.
% Bimodality             - Routines for testing for bimodality and related.
% Calibration            - Calibration support routines.
% Colorimetric           - Color calculations and related.
% D70Toolbox             - Tools for processing digital camera images, particular those from a Nikon D70.

%                          like it appeared in Matlab 2013a.
% xOld                   - We think these are no longer used.

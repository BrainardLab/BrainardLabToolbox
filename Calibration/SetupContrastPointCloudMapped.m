%
% Description:
%     Here we quantize jointly across the three primaries, using an
%     exhaustive search process.  Amazingly, it is feasible to search all
%     possible quantized settings for each image pixel, and choose the
%     settings that best approximate the desired LMS excitations at that
%     pixel.
%
%     Compute an array with all possible triplets of screen settings,
%     quantized on the interval [0,1].
%
%     This method takes all possible screen settings and creates a point
%     cloud of the corresponding cone contrasts. It then finds the settings
%     that come as close as possible to producing the desired cone contrast
%     at each point in the image. It's a little slow but conceptually
%     simple and fast enough to be feasible.
%
%Â Inputs:
%    calObj -                     Screen cal object to use to make a point
%                                 cloud. This object defines both device
%                                 properties and the sensor color space in
%                                 which we compute contrast.
%    bgExcitations -              Screen background excitations (aka sensor values)
%                                 for calculation of contrasts.
%
% Outputs:
%    ptCld -                      Screen point cloud results.
%    ptCldSettingsCal -           All screen settings for desired contrasts
%                                 in cal format. This cal format strings out the
%                                 values for all pixesl along the columns, easier for
%                                 color space conversions than image format.
%    ptCldContrastCal -           All contrasts in cal format.
%    ptCldExcitationsCal -        All excitations in cal format.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    'verbose' -                  Boolean. Default true.  Controls the printout.

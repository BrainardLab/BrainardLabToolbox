% Description:
%     The method above is subject to imperfect quantization because each primary is
%     quantized individually. Here we'll quantize jointly across the three
%     primaries, using an exhaustive search process.  Amazingly, it is feasible
%     to search all possible quantized settings for each image pixel, and choose
%     the settings that best approximate the desired LMS excitations at that pixel.
%     
%     Compute an array with all possible triplets of screen settings,
%     quantized on the interval [0,1].
%     
%     This method takes all possible screen settings and creates a
%     point cloud of the corresponding cone contrasts. It then finds
%     the settings that come as close as possible to producing the
%     desired cone contrast at each point in the image. It's a little
%     slow but conceptually simple and fast enough to be feasible.

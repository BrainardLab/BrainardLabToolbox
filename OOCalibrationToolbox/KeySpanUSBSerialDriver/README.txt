The Keyspan USB Serial driver is proprietary to the manufacturer. It is provided here for convenience. You will need to install the driver in order for the software to communicate with different measurement devices, such as the PR-650 spectro photometer.

After the driver is installed, you will need to reboot your computer. 


Additional notes: 
(1) For OS X < 10.9, use the Keyspan v2.6.4.dmg driver.

(2) For OS X >= 10.9,  use the USA-19HSdvr-10.9.10_10.11_v4_signed driver.

(2a) During installation of the USA-19HSdvr-10.9.10_10.11_v4_signed driver, when you reach the page with the ‘Customize’ button (bottom left), uncheck the USAdriverFolder option before proceeding with the remainder of the installation.

(2b) This driver worked on a laptop running 10.9, but it crashed an iMac (kernel panic) running 10.11

(2c) This driver worked on a 17” Macbook Pro (David’s old laptop) running 10.11.4 (ElCapitan)

So your mileage may vary.

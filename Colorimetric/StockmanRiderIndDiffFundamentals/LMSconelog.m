% This returns the fits to the Stockman-Sharp LMS absorbances.  Paper
% Figure 1 and Table 1.
%
% Pass 'lin' as last argument to get linear absorbance, otherwise returns log10
% absorbance.
%
% Return is matrix with four columns, first is wavelength in nm, then L, M, and S
% absorbances (or log10 absorbances) in that order.

% Adopted by Claude AI and DHB from Stockman-Rider paper and Python code.  See

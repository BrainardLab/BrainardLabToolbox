Steps for Using LabJack with MATLAB on Mac OS X

1) Install Xcode
Note: Only the command line tools are required; but not all Xcode versions offer the "command-line only" option. If you do not wish to use Xcode, you can delete all of the Xcode-related files (e.g. /Developer/Documentation) after installation.
For OS X 10.6, any version of Xcode up to 4.1 is fine
For OS X 10.7, any version of Xcode 4+ is fine. You can use the command-line tools installer for 4.3.3, for example. You must also apply this fix for MATLAB:

2) Install the LabJack "Exodriver":

You can use the "pre-built" installer on OS X 10.6 and 10.7, which includes libusb.

3) Get the MATLAB code. This code has been tested on MATLAB R2012, but it should run fine on older releases up to R2009. Put the MATLAB code in a directory that is on the MATLAB path.
